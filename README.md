# Cat Breed Classifier Webapp
A cat breed classifier model and interactive app.
Available online here: https://catbreedclassifier.streamlit.app/

## Background
Fine-grain classification is an interesting and exciting problem in machine learning. To some it may just be an exercise in pushing the latest and greatest models, but solving this problem can be worth so much more. 

Cats are often misclassified on adoption sites. This can lead to confusion for the adopters and directly impact the adoptees. Different breeds have different needs, health risks, and personality traits, and, armed with this knowledge, humanity can benefit our feline companions.

## Features
- Prediction
- Selectable Models
- Downloadable Dataset Add-On
- Feature Map Visualization
- Model Information 

## Usage
Simply upload a picture of a cat on the main page, and a prediction will be generated. From, there feel free to explore the image as seen through the selected model and a link to more information about the breed on the Prediction Information page here https://catbreedclassifier.streamlit.app/Prediction_Information. 

Want to try training your own model? Download our dataset and combine it with Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset. Our dataset can be found here https://github.com/wlalp/Domestic-Shorthairs, or linked on the Data Page at https://catbreedclassifier.streamlit.app/Data_Page.

Want to know more about your selected model? The model summary from Keras can be viewed on the Model Information page here https://catbreedclassifier.streamlit.app/Model_Information.
